				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>One challenge I ran into was figuring out how I was going to implement my
					sortedUserName() function that I used in lab7. Because I had not taken into
					account that the input was a string, I forgot to convert it into an array that I would sort
					and then convert back into a string. I also had trouble at first figuring out where the Event
					Listener needed to go but I used some class examples from the slideshow to help me out.
				</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The biggest problem I faced was figuring out why my input was not appearing on
					my website. Whenever I used console.log() to check if the function in the Javascript
					code was working, the message appeared and disappeared within a second after I clicked
					the button. I couldn't figure out for a very long time and ended up changing a lot of 
					Javascript stuff and it seemed like nothing was working. However, I ended up solving
					my problem when I got rid of the form tag that I surrounded the label, input, and button
					tag in. When I did that, the input was printed on the website in the sorted form.
