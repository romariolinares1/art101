		<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The biggest challenge I had was figuring out what kind of issue each lab error had. The
			labs that I featured on this lab website all had instances where something was wrong in the
			HTML file. However, it took me a while to find if the errors were appearing in their Javascript
			files or their HTML files. I used several debugging strategies like commenting out code and using
			console.log() to see what my issues were.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The most common problem I ran into while debugging previous labs was that they all had
			the exact same issue with their Javascript. Specifically, functions would run twice
			in the Javascript file and I couldn't figure out what it was until I started debugging 
			by using console.log(). I found out that I was referring to the Javascript file twice
			in the HTML file which caused the functions in those labs to run twice.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here are the results of debugging previous labs:</p>

				<h3>Lab 5:</h3>
				<p>When looking in the console, it appeared that the Javascript function was running
					without an input for the function when the page opened up. It was almost as if the 
					function ran once before it ran the second time which made it work. To fix this, I 
					commented out the script tag that was placed in the header section of my HTML. I did
					this because there was already a script tag in the output div section calling for
					the Javascript file. Having the script tag in both the header and output div made the
					HTML code call for the functions in the Javascript file twice.

				<h3>Lab 6:</h3>
				<p>This lab had the same issue Lab 5 did. When looking in the console, it appeared that the Javascript function was running
					without an input for the function when the page opened up. It was almost as if the 
					function ran once before it ran the second time which made it work. To fix this, I 
					commented out the script tag that was placed in the header section of my HTML. I did
					this because there was already a script tag in the output div section calling for
					the Javascript file. Having the script tag in both the header and output div made the
					HTML code call for the functions in the Javascript file twice.

				<h3>Lab 7:</h3>
				<p>Lab 7 had the same issue as the previous labs did. However, it was more challenging to fix
					because lab 7 had a window prompt input that made it more confusing if it was an HTML or
					Javascript problem. I wrote some console.log() functions in the Javascript function for
					debugging to see what the issue was. I saw in the console that certain messages were printing twice
					which also made sense seeing that the window prompt input screen popped up twice as well. When I
					looked over my HTML code, I saw that there were two instances where I referenced the Javascript
					file so I commented out the one in the header to make it so the HTML file only calls for the Javascript
					file once.
