				<h2 class="header2">Challenge</h2>
				<p class="text">One of the biggest challenges I ran into while doing this assignment
					was trying to figure out how to change the CSS using Javascript of elements that
					had same class names. I wanted to do this because I didn't want to use up a lot
					of white space if I can find a way to change the CSS of every element with the 
					same class name. I had to look up on multiple sources to find out how to do this.
					I ended up finding out how to do this using the getElementsByClassName() feature
					and by using a for loop that I found on W3Schools that will help change every HTML
					element with that CSS class name.
				</p>
				<h2 class="header2">Problems</h2>
				<p class="text">A frequent problem I had was forgetting to put the '.style' when I was
					changing the CSS through the Javascript file. When I kept forgetting to add that key
					feature, the CSS never showed up on the page and I was wondering why nothing was changing.
					I tried looking up multiple other ways to change the CSS for certain elements. However, I 
					realized later on that the CSS wasn't changing on the website because I forgot to add the
					'.style' part before the actual CSS feature part.
