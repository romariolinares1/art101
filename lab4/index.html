			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The biggest challenge I ran into was figuring out how to write the
					pseudocode for how the game detects what player won. Rock, Papers, and Scissors
					has a lot of win conditions so it made it hard for me to figure out how the 
					code could calculate those results. I ended up writing condition statements
					as placeholders for the game.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didn't really have a lot of problems with this lab assignment. The only
					actual problem I had was figuring out how to do sub tasks in the form as sub 
					bullet points on the lab website for the every day task implementation. I later
					figured out by experimenting that making an unordered list with a "li" tag inside
					made it a bullet point instead of a number in an ordered list.
				</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Here is the result of my Javascript pseudocode for an Every Day Task list and a
					Rock, Papers, Scissors game:</p>
				<h2>Everyday Task:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Wake up by an alarm</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Make sure to open eyes</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Get out of your bed</li>
					<li>Walk over to your alarm and turn it off</li>
					<li>Turn on your room lights</li>
					<li>Go to the bathroom</li>
					<li>Wash your face with water then brush your teeth</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Apply any other bath products you use like floss.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Apply facial care and head back to your room</li>
					<li>Get dressed in new clothes</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Pick clothes appropriate for the kind of day you are going out for</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Get ready for the day</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:</h2>
				<pre><code>
				// Print the options each turn for both players
				// One user input from both players is accepted: rocks, paper, or scissors
				// Print countdown as in... 3, 2, 1 or rock, paper, scissor!
					// If rock and paper...
						// Print paper wins
					// Else if rock and scissors...
						// Print rock wins
					// Else if paper and scissors...
						// Print scissors wins
					// Else if player 1 input = player 2 imput...
						// Print tie
							// Give user input again and restart from step 2
				</pre></code>
