		<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>My main challenge I had with this assignment was getting confused on what to specifically
			do. When I looked at the examples on the Canvas assignment, they displayed completely
			different stuff that the assignment never mentioned. I was confused because I thought I had
			to follow what the examples were showing. However, by referring to what we did in class, I was
			able to find out how I needed to display my output on the website. 
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>One problem I ran into in my Javascript code was that it wasn't printing out the strings combined
			together if none of the numbers was a multiple of 3, 5, or 7. When I was looking through the lecture
			video again to see what my issue was, I realized that I was using the wrong conditional statements.
			Instead of using only "If then" statements for all my conditionals, I used "else if" statements.
			When I changed the conditional statements, everything fixed itself.
