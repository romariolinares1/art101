				<p class="intro">Student
					BA, Arts & Design: Games & Playable Media
					University of California, Santa Cruz
				</p>
				<p>I am currently a second year student and will be in my third year next Fall Quarter.
					I have a lot of experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding since my
					high school provided me with a lot of web development practice classes. I also
					have some experience with Python coding as I had to take some Python courses
					at the beginning of my first year at UCSC. Recently, I've been getting into
					D&D a lot! I play about 3 different campaigns a week 3 times a week on campus 
					with a bunch of my friends. Because they've got me hooked on D&D, I'm also 
					planning to run my own D&D campaign for my friends so I hope to wow them with
					imagination and worldbuilding. I also love to draw and D&D is helping me stay
					motivated to improve my art skills. I am also proficient in other technical programs
					like Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Illustrator. In the future, 
					I hope to be a video game designer working for a famous video game company.</p>
