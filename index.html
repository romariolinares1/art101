					<h1>Romario Linares</h1>
					<p><b>Student</b></p>
					<p>BA, Arts & Design: Games & Playable Media</p>
					<p>University of California, Santa Cruz</p>
					<p>I am currently a second year student and will be in my third year next Fall Quarter.
						I have a lot of experience with <b>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</b> coding since my
						high school provided me with a lot of web development practice classes. I also
						have some experience with <b>Python</b> coding as I had to take some Python courses
						at the beginning of my first year at UCSC. Recently, I've been getting into
						D&D a lot! I play about 3 different campaigns a week 3 times a week on campus 
						with a bunch of my friends. Because they've got me hooked on D&D, I'm also 
						planning to run my own D&D campaign for my friends so I hope to wow them with
						imagination and worldbuilding. I also love to draw and D&D is helping me stay
						motivated to improve my art skills. I am also proficient in other technical programs
						like <b>Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Illustrator.</b> In the future, 
						I hope to be a video game designer working for a famous video game company.
