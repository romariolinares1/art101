                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>A challenge I had while doing this lab was writing a simplified version of
                    the function to reduce the amount of space I was using in the file. Instead of
                    declaring/creating a bunch of variables in the function, I returned one of the
                    variables back using the .sort().join('') features combined.
                </p>
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I didn't have a lot of problems doing this lab. However, one problem I would
                    consider that I encountered was accidentally putting a parameter within the
                    sortedUserName() function. In doing so, the code wouldn't work and I got
                    confused until I experimented around with console.log() and the function itself
                    to see what would work.
                </p>
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>This is the result of my Javascript code:</p>
                <div class="output">
                    <h3>Script Output</h3>
                    <script src="js/lab.js"></script>
                </div>
