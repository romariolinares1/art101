		<h1>Lab 16 - JSON & APIs</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>One challenge I had with this lab was understanding where to begin. Looking back at the lecture
			video and slides, I was still a little confused on how to work with JSON files with the ajax function.
			However, after seeing some examples from students and the Canvas assignment, I was able to pick
			up quickly on what I needed to do.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>One problem I frequently ran into while making this lab was that grabbing the JSON file 
			using the ajax function was never working. It always popped up the error "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"
			in the console and never allowed me to use the data from the external JSON file. The way I was able
			fix this was using the CORS Unblock google extension to always allow my code to use external
			JSON files.
