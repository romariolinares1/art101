		<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>My biggest challenge was figuring how to actually use the AJAX function and implement an
			API by its URL. I wasn't able to attend the lecture because I had to sort out some
			urgent business so I was unfamiliar with the AJAX/API lesson. After looking at the resources
			on Canvas and Discord, I was able to figure out how to type out the AJAX function that I needed.
			I was also able to figure out how to grab certain sections from an API using the data feature.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The one problem I faced while doing this lab was trying to print a specific section/category
			from the API that I chose. Whenever I tried returnning 'data' it just returned as undefined
			in both console and website page. By looking through the console where the full library was 
			printed for the specific category, I found how to access a specific section of it. I realized you
			had to do data.nameofcategory.
