		<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>I didn't really have any challenges while doing this lab since I'm already very familiar with
			how conditional statements work in Javascript and other programming languages.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>One problem I ran into was that my sortingHat() function continued to return unidentified
			values. When I used console.log() to see if the input length was given a modulus number,
			it showed that it was. However, I later found that one of my else if condition statements
			was using an incorrect number as its value which caused the function to not return anything.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p></p>
		<div class="input-output">
			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			<p>Please enter your name for sorting!</p>
			<input type="text" id="input">
			<button id="button">Submit</button>
			<div id="output"></div>
