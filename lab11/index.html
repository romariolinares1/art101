				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The main challenge I had while doing this lab was trying to figure out how to
					create my own buttons using jQuery. I initially started with created the button
					elements in the HTML file but realized I had to make them in the Javascript file.
					After looking over the slides for some hints, I found out that you had to use the
					.append() feature to add a new HTML element in the file from the Javascript file.

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>One problem I had with this assignment was how some of the instructions were a little
					too vague. There were times where I didn't understand what some of the tasks wanted.
					To be more specific, I had difficulty understanding what Task 3 meant by toggle a class
					"special" for the div sections and css/style each section. I ended up having the buttons
					toggle a class with the name of "special" for every div section that would change the
					background color to reveal the text that was hidden.
