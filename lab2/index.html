			<h1>Hello World</h1>

				<h2>About Me: Romario Linares (he/him)</h2>
				<p>I am an Arts & Design: Games & Playable Media major at UCSC. Currently, 
					I am a second year student and will be in my third year next Fall Quarter.
					I have a lot of experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding since my
					high school provided me with a lot of web development practice classes. I also
					have some experience with Python coding as I had to take some Python courses
					at the beginning of my first year at UCSC. Recently, I've been getting into
					D&D a lot! I play about 3 different campaigns a week 3 times a week on campus 
					with a bunch of my friends. Because they've got me hooked on D&D, I'm also 
					planning to run my own D&D campaign for my friends so I hope to wow them with
					imagination and worldbuilding.

				<h2>My Partner: Gabriela Rioja (she/they)</h2>
				<p>My partner is a Sociology and LALS (Latin American & Latin Studies) major at
					UCSC. She's a great partner and asks a lot of questions so that both of us can 
					understand details of the assignment instructions. While talking with her, she 
					said that she loves to snack on chips. Her current show that she is binging is a
					show called Scandal. I haven't heard of the show myself but I bet it is good. She's
					also very creative and insists on experimenting on our approaches with our lab 
					assignments.
