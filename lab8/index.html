				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>One challenge I had was figuring out what kind of operation I wanted to do.
					I didn't want to copy the canvas example, so I decided to use the .sqrt() and
					the / operations.
				</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>A problem I ran into while doing this was figuring out how to properly implement
					the .sqrt() operation. I found out that just having sqrt(variable) doesn't work 
					because you need to implement "Math." before sqrt() in order to have it work in
					a browser.
				</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p><s>Go to the console to see the output!</s> Just kidding! The results are actually here!</p>
