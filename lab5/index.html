					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>One challenge I had while doing this lab was figuring out if we needed to
						make/declare variables using "var" or without "var". I was worried that by 
						using "var", I would've done the assignment incorrectly. However, after 
						asking some people in the class, I realized that I could write the variables
						using "var" or without it.
					</p>
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't run into a lot of problems. However, one small problem that I had was
						figuring out how to declare a boolean variable. I shuffled between declaring
						the variable as "= False" or "== False". I then realized shortly that the true
						or false statement needed to be lowercased and it's just one "=".
